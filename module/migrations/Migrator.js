/*
Behold... THE ALL-MIGHTY Migrator OBJECT

Its job is to take a single Entity object (Actor, Item, etc.) and upgrade it. It assumes that
every monitored object has a "version" field whose value is an integer whose value is >= 0.

To keep things simple, you need simply expose a single object: each Migrator can have a link
to the previous one and the Migrator will take care of calling the previous Migrator if it's
aware of it.

Version numbers MUST NOT be updated inside the function, the Migrator itself will handle
the process.

Migration functions receive a copy of the original so don't worry about mutating
